## Description

This was my first semester project. We had to make a webpage for a new museum, given premade text and sitemap. All had to be done with only HTML and CSS.
This whole assignment follows a template that i made to be as reusable as possible. All the images were cut to thumbnail sizes, and optimized for web.

The site contains the following pages:
- Home
- Explore
- Exhibition spaces
- Special events and exhibitions
- Visit
- Get involved

I choose to make a margin on a section class with a transparent dark background that could be used on all pages.
The "hr" had margin for seperating "paragraphs" equaly.
Each page has an unique static background that appels to the youngest target group, together with the layout and structure that applies for the older target group.



The best thing i learned from this project is the simplicity you get if you think ahead and plan the structure of the page you`re about to make.
